# Logancoin: Future_of_Lending

What is Logancoin?

Logancoin is a decentralized “peer to peer” lending cryptocurrency that stipulates a fair distribution of wealth so that investors like YOU can have a fair and credible opportunity to invest, lend or reinvest in Logancoin starting from 1$ only. 

How does it work?

Logancoin users will be able to start lending, reinvesting or withdrawing their assets right after the ICO, they can do this freely without having to wait a long time, this is because there is no contract. 

By investing in Logancoin you get acess to an exclusive and custom made volatility trading software, this means that you will be increasing your chances of making a future proof and solid investment.

Is it proof of work or stake?

Logancoin can be mined on a very clever algorithm, and all you need to do that is a computer. We have a great surprise on this operation which we will release to the public a few days before the Mining Pool is released.
